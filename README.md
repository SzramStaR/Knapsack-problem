# Knapsack Problem Algorithms

This project implements different algorithms to solve the knapsack problem in Python. The following algorithms are included:

- Greedy Algorithm: Solves the knapsack problem using a greedy approach by selecting items with the highest value-to-weight ratio until the knapsack capacity is reached.
- Brute Force Algorithm: Solves the knapsack problem by exhaustively checking all possible combinations of items using a brute force approach.
- Dynamic Programming Algorithm: Solves the knapsack problem using dynamic programming to efficiently compute the optimal solution based on the subproblems.

## Installation

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in your Python development environment.

3. Run the `main.py` file to execute the program.

## Usage

The program provides a menu to choose the input method for the knapsack problem and the algorithm to solve it. Follow the instructions provided in the console to enter the required input and select the desired algorithm. The program will display the selected items, their total value, and the total weight.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the knapsack problem, which is a classic optimization problem in computer science. Special thanks to the authors of the algorithms and approaches used in this project.
